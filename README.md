# J2534DotNet
J2534 .NET Library written by Roland Harrison (roland.c.harrison@gmail.com) using a modified J2534 libray
that was originally forked from mkelly/kuzkok

This library is available to be forked or used as is third party projects providing I am contacted for permission.

The ALPHA sample application is exactly that, an ALPHA. It must not be used to program cars that are driven on the street. 

It currently will read and write the flash from BF/FG Australian Falcons with NO ERROR CHECKING

If you attempt to write the flash to another vehicle it will BRICK THE PCM

This is a proof of concept only and will not be further developed.

# J2534DotNet
J2534 .NET Library written by Roland Harrison (roland.c.harrison@gmail.com) using a heavily modified J2534 libray
that was originally forked from mkelly/kuzkok

This library is available to be forked or used as is third party projects providing I am contacted for permission.

The ALPHA sample application is exactly that, an ALPHA. It must not be used to program cars that are driven on the street. 

It currently will read and write the flash from BF/FG Australian Falcons with minimal error checking.
If you use this program there is absolutely no support or warranty and it must be done so at your own risk.

The J2534/OBD/UDS library will continue to remain public.
The sample program is a proof of concept only and will not be further developed.

For newer updates and more features see the complete version here which is now closed source
